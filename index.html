          In this post i will be talking about what cybersecurity is, why it is
          important and some key concepts in the cyberspace. This post is for
          all those who want to enter the cyberworld, it is for noobies in tech,
          and also for those who love to learn.
        </p>

        <p>So now, the question: <b>What is Cybersecurity?</b></p>

        <p>
          Cybersecurity can be defined as (sorry am not starting this as a
          lecture, so we are going to make it fun and simple) Cybersecurity is
          ... Ok ok wait a minute before I continue there is a warning: "As you
          learn further you will find out that you are in a battle between you
          and cybercriminal, i mean you are going to be the ethical one here,
          right? I hope you don't turn to the evil side.
        </p>

        <p>
          But you need to know anyone can be a victim to cyber attack including
          you even i too, no matter how small or great, unpopular or popular you
          are. But there are tons of ways to reduce the chances of that. So on
          this path i will be helping you to become a Ethical Cybersecurity
          Ninja. So now back to "What is Cybersecurity", to make it plain and
          simple as there is no general meaning, Cybersecurity is the battle
          between us and cyber criminals, it involves the methods and steps
          taken in keeping our selves and our data safe from criminals.
        </p>

        <p>So with that said, <b>Why is Cybersecurity so important? </b></p>

        <p>
          Like i have said, we are in a battle between us and cybercriminal, we
          need to learn how to keep ourselves, our data and even others safe in
          the cyberworld.
        </p>

        <p>
          As almost everything, every business is starting to use the internet
          for daily activities so is the risk of attacks also increasing. So it
          is really, i mean it, it is really important to keep ourselves safe.
          Almost every thing is going to the cloud. Basics in Cybersecurity
          needs to be known by us, our parents, our grandparents, even children.
          We are all to keep our selves safe out there cause it is a really
          dangerous world out there, but with God's help we will overcome. Now
          we can't be unhackable or immune to cyber attacks but we can
          drastically reduce the risk of cyber attacks targeted at us.
        </p>

        <p>So now, let's talk about some <b>Terms in Cybersecurity</b></p>

        <p>
          A lot of terms are used in cybersecurity especially when referring to
          an attacks or something of sort, therefore we all need to learn these
          terms:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Malware:</b>
            <p>
              Malware means Malicious Software, yes, it is referred to
              categories of software that can cause harm to your system, there
              are various bad things these softwares can do to a system.
            </p>

            <img
              src="assets/depositphotos_263293254-stock-photo-malware-detected-warning-screen.jpg"
              alt="malware"
              class="image"
              id="malware"
              draggable="false"
            />
            <p>Malware are classified into various categories like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b><i>Spyware:</i></b> This malware which when installed (as the
                name says) spies on you, it can gather your personal
                informations, without you giving it permissions.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b><i>Ransomware:</i></b> This is a malware that encrypt or
                restrict victim access to their computer system until a ransom
                is paid. They usually use vulnerability in the system or any
                software to gain access and then encrypt your files
              </li>
              <li>
                <b><i>Trojan:</i></b> This is a software that is disguised as a
                piece of harmless and sometimes even desirable software, but the
                truth is they perform malicious act. Malwarebytes also have this
                to say about the origin of the name
                <i
                  ><mark
                    >"Beware of Greeks bearing gifts: In Virgil’s epic poem, The
                    Aeneid, a clever Greek war strategist named Odysseus devises
                    a plan to get his men inside the walled city of Troy.
                    Instead of destroying or climbing the city’s walls, Odysseus
                    sees another way in: with deception. Trojan soldiers watch
                    as the Greeks appear to sail away, leaving behind a giant
                    wooden horse as a token of surrender. Drunk on victory, the
                    Trojans bring the horse inside their walls, only to discover
                    Odysseus and his men were hidden inside the whole
                    time."</mark
                  ></i
                >
                So Trojan just act legitmate but contain dangerous things that
                can harm your system. We also have RAT (Remote Access Trojan),
                this type of trojan gives the bad guy remote access and control
                of your PC or phone. So he or she is able to access important
                files and stuff.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b><i>Virus:</i></b> A virus, specifically, is a type of malware
                that replicates itself by attaching to other programs or files
                on a computer. Viruses can cause a range of problems, including:

                <ul>
                  <li>Deleting or corrupting files</li>
                  <li>Crashing or freezing the computer</li>
                  <li>Stealing personal information</li>
                  <li>Spreading to other computers</li>
                  <li>Displaying unwanted ads or messages</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                <b><i>Worms:</i></b> Imagine your computer is a house, and a
                worm is like a unwanted visitor who enters your house without
                permission. Once inside, the worm:
                <ul>
                  <li>Makes copies of itself</li>
                  <li>Moves around your house (computer) and causes trouble</li>
                  <li>
                    Can even invite other unwanted visitors (like viruses or
                    malware)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Can steal or damage your belongings like your files or data
                  </li>
                </ul>

                The worst part? Worms can spread to other houses (computers)
                connected to yours, causing even more trouble!
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <p>
            So that is enough on Malware, yeah malware is really long and
            interesting to know and understand. But let's move to the next term.
          </p>

          <li>
            <b>Cyber Attacks:</b> Yeah i know, i know, we've mentioned this
            several times, so what does this mean, Cyber Attacks are really
            offensive actions taken or carried out by cybercriminal who could do
            things like install malware on your device, perform some social
            engineering tricks on you (We will talk about this next)
          </li>
          <br />

          <li>
            <b><i>Social Engineering</i></b
            >: Social engineering is the use of psychological manipulation to
            fool someone into disclosing personal or sensitive information, or
            into taking activities that could jeopardize security or privacy. It
            is a sort of cybercrime that targets human behavior rather than
            technological flaws.

            />

            Social engineers utilize a variety of strategies to control their
            victims, including:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Phishing: Fraudulent emails, texts, or communications that look
                to be from a reputable source and attempt to deceive people into
                disclosing critical information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pretexting: Creating a fake scenario or story to earn an
                individual's trust and collect confidential information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Whaling: This is the use of sophisticated social engineering
                attacks to target high-level executives or officials.
              </li>
              <li>
                Vishing: Using phone calls to deceive people into disclosing
                critical information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Smishing: The practice of deceiving someone into disclosing
                private information via SMS or text messages.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <br />

          <li>
            <b><i>Logic Bomb:</i></b> This is a malicious code that is usually
            placed in a program and will blow up (execute) when a certain
            condition is met or an action is carried out.
          </li>

          <br />
          <li>
            <b><i>Vulnerabilities:</i></b> Vulnerabilities refer to weaknesses
            or flaws in a system, network, or application that can be exploited
            by attackers to gain unauthorized access, control, or data.

              </li>
              <li>
                Human factor: Weak passwords, phishing, social engineering, or
                inadequate training.
              </li>
              <li>
                Configuration: Insecure settings, misconfigured firewalls, or
                poorly managed access controls.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b><i>Exploit:</i></b> An exploit is a technique or tool used to
            take advantage of a vulnerability or weakness in a system, network,
            or application to gain unauthorized access, control, or data.

            Exploits can be categorized into several types, including:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Remote exploits: Attackers use a remote connection to exploit a
                vulnerability.
              </li>
              <li>
                Local exploits: Attackers have physical access to the system or
                network.
              </li>
              <li>
                Client-side exploits: Attackers target vulnerabilities in
                client-side applications or software.
              </li>
              <li>
                Server-side exploits: Attackers target vulnerabilities in
                server-side applications or software.
              </li>
              <li>
                Zero-day exploits: Attackers use previously unknown
                vulnerabilities before a patch or fix is available.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
